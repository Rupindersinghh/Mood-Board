Overview:
This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to automatically generate artistic mood boards. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and combines it with creative collage algorithms (including grid and masonry layouts) to arrange images into visually compelling mood boards. Itâ€™s designed for designers, creative technologists, and anyone interested in the intersection of AI and visual arts.

Key Features:

Automated Image Classification:
Uses a CNN (built with TensorFlow/Keras) to classify fashion-related images. The model is trained on datasets like Fashion MNIST and can be adapted for custom image sets.

Dynamic Collage Generation:
Implements multiple layout strategies:

Fixed Grid Layout: Uniformly resizes and arranges images in a neat grid.
Masonry Layout: Organizes images in columns of varying heights to create an organic, Pinterest-style collage.
Artistic Enhancements: Applies random scaling, rotation, contrast adjustments, and borders to images for a more dynamic, visually appealing output.
Customizability:
Easily tweak parameters such as board dimensions, number of columns, spacing, and transformation ranges to suit different aesthetic preferences.

Multi-Platform Support:
The code can run in Jupyter Notebook for rapid prototyping or as a standalone Python script from the command line, making it versatile for development and deployment.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras for CNN modeling
PIL/Pillow for image processing
Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
Usage Example:

Train or Load the CNN Model:
Train your model using Fashion MNIST (or another dataset) to classify images, then save the model for inference.

Generate a Mood Board:
Run the provided scripts to read images from specified folders, apply transformations, and generate a mood board. For example, the script uses a masonry layout to create a collage, which is then displayed or saved as an image file.
